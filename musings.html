					<h3>Words about things that interest me.</h3>

						<!-- Third Blog Post -->

<!-- 						<h1 class="postTitle mt-5 mb-0">Tale of Two Cities?</h1>
						<p class="subtitle">An outsider's perspective on the Hong Kong extradition protests
						<p class="date">2019/08<p> -->

						<!-- Second Blog Post -->

						<h1 class="postTitle mt-5 mb-0">Intersection of Hip Hop and Jazz</h1>
						<p class="subtitle">Discourse on the relationship between Hip Hop and Jazz. More to come.</i>
<!-- 						<p class="date">2019/06</p>
						<p class="blogText">I like Hip Hop. I also like Jazz. I've found myself wondering what similarities could be found between the two genres. Music is growing less insular especially with genres drawing inspiration from one another, whether it may be subject matter, rhythmic or sonic differences, or cultural influences. As it turns out, Jazz and Hip Hop share a lot in common, which could explain the reason I enjoy both so much! I wrote this in an effort to identify the qualities of each genre that make them so appealing to me (and perhaps others?)
						</p>
						<p class="blogText">All forms of music provide a means of self expression. It can be a reflection of a culture, a medium for political or religious dissemination, and of course the portrayal of the dozens of emotions and experiences people have. All of these things are present in Hip Hop and Jazz. However, I'd argue there are certain additional similarities that connect the two genres.</p>
						<p class="blogText">Jazz has African American roots spanning back to the 1900s, where it drew influence from West African music and incorporated traditionally European instruments. Post-slavery America was obviously a period of extreme hardship with open discrimination and oppression. Jazz music helped provide a release to these things. At the time, Jazz was gaining traction among the mainstream and predominantly white audience (Great Gatsby anyone?) Although initially frowned upon, Jazz was soon embraced by America. It's ties to the black community were undeniable, and eventually we all arrive to the same conclusion: music is loved regardless of colour. You could even argue the Jazz Age was a development towards the civil rights movement. </p>
						<p class="blogText">Hip Hop arose from a similar environment of turmoil and racial tension. </p> -->

						<p class="blogText">Hi. Welcome to my first blog post. This is a place for me to journal about anything and everything. </p>
						<p class="blogText">As a student, it can be easy to become absorbed in whatever you're studying. They say engineers can't spell, or articulate themselves in a non-technical way for that matter. As much as I hate to admit, writing this was exasperatingly difficult. All of a sudden putting two words together requires . . . actual effort? Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed English class in high school; I even find myself missing it sometimes. But wait. An engineer who likes words? Likes the subjectivty of interpreting literature? Finds joy in using . . . <em>figurative</em> language?? How amusing. Moreover, how contrary to the rules of engineering design :p</p>
						<p class="blogText">I know that dedicating myself to the study of engineering may shutter certain aspects of my identity. This space gives me a medium which I can use to reconcile that. And hey, maybe I'll gain an internet presence in the process. As I've settled down into my life in university and the busy city of Toronto, I decided it would be comforting to have a place like this to write freely about whatever I'd like. </p>
						<p class="blogText">I don't know how or why you've gotten this far. But if you have, here are some of the subjects you can look forward to reading about: music(all sorts), programming(all sorts), and all sorts of other things(idk yet). Keep in touch. <!-- Maybe you'll find reading my blog more enjoyable than <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Engineering-Mechanics-Statics-Dynamics-14th/dp/0133915425/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=statics+and+dynamics+hibbeler&qid=1552628814&s=books&sr=1-1" target="_blank">this.</a> bleh.</p> -->
