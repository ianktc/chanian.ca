            <p class="text">Dear Hiring Manager, <br><br>

            I am writing to you regarding the Software Developer position at Security Compass. I currently study in a Computer Engineering Undergraduate degree in University of Toronto. I found this position on the university career portal and was very excited by the role! <br><br>

            My education insofar in UofT Engineering has given me fundamental knowledge and valuable experience in digital electronics, object programming, circuits, algorithms and more. However most importantly, it has improved upon my ability to learn, problem solve, and adapt. I have already taken dozens of courses in my time here at UofT, many of which I grappled with, and some of which I thoroughly enjoyed. My ultimate takeaway from the past two years is the focus on my passions, and dialing in the required skills to forward them. <br><br>

            What are my passions then?<br><br>

            Tackling complex software challenges is a big passion of mine. I love the process involved with breaking down a problem or bug, crafting an approach, and implementing it. Furthermore, I really enjoy doing these things in a collaborative setting. One particular experience of collaborative software development was when my team and I developed a GIS Mapping Application. As a course that sought to model the software development process, I developed skills that would serve me well in a work environment. I have gotten acclimated to the Git revision tool, learned and practised debugging approaches, and also somewhat importantly, practised my ability to Google issues. In a real world setting with the Internet at your disposal, I have picked up different tricks on how to seek help when issues/bugs arise. <br><br>

            I will also add that much of the time my passion with software development will crossover into other spheres of my life. I am always looking at ways I can involve my other interests, whether they be financial invesment, software security, health & fitness, data analytics or business consulting. I think my interest in data security would be a great complement to the role at Security Compass, and I would be very interested in working on a product that involves this!<br><br>

            Thank you for your time and consideration. I strongly believe I could make a solid contribution to the team at Security Compass and would appreciate the opportunity to talk more about the position. <br><br>

            Best Regards, <br><br>

            Ian Chan
